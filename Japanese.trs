THE MARKETPLACE

I had that dream again

It's like a broken record

Going around and around

But I know a way.

One day...

I will break it.

Demo

A BAD DREAM?

And just like that...

Our lives would change, forever.

IS THIS ALL REAL?

But I don't need any help!

I'm fine! There's nothing wrong with me!

It must be her fault! She did this to me!

TAKEN

Don't worry...

Everything will be okay...

We'll get through this...

I promise.

ESCAPE?

W-What is happening to me?

Why can't I just be "normal"?

OF BLOOD AND WATER

She should've had her life ruined! Not me!

I don't deserve this, you do! 

A LONG RIDE HOME

Heh, ya know...

this is kinda fun!

We should do this more often...but it's a little late now.

THE BUS STOP

It's kinda creepy out here...

but strangely farmilliar. I feel too comfortable.

COLD RAILS

We're almost home.

I can feel it getting closer.

But...

What will happen once we reach home?

Will everything go back to the way it was?

...

Will Luzia and I go back to the way we were?

Will I lose my sister...

Forever?

WAKE UP...PLEASE?

The tunnel of sorrows...

It shows us our worst realities.

I couldn't tell her the truth about what I saw.

It'll haunt me forever.

OUR LAST STOP

Well...this is it...

the end of the line.

I'm glad we grew closer, together. 

We're all counting on you, Luzia. 

BREAK OR STRENGTHEN

Home...just the way it was. 

It's finally over.

Or is it?

The truth lies in the reflection of my name.

HAPPILY EVER AFTER

S-She did it.

Thank you, Luzia! I love you so much! 

Thank you, Luzia.

We did it!

Wake up!

P-Please?
なぜ私はここにいるのですか？
Anybody?
誰かいませんか？
I-I need to find my way home!

W-What are you doing here?
あなたはここで何をしているの？
I need your help, Luzia.
私はあなたを助けたいです
Not here! People will see you!
ここではありません！人々はあなたを見つけるでしょう！
B-But I...
しかし、私 ...
Just go away, Sombria! 
私をほっといて！
Luzia...
...
Just go!
私をほっといて！
Why can't she just leave me alone. 
彼女が他の人に見られるのは危険すぎる。
*Sigh* I'm sorry, Sombria.
ごめん。
We'll figure this out soon.
家に帰る道を見つける必要がある
I can't open it.

The lock's broken.

Hello!?

Is anyone in there!?

I guess not.

It's a poster for a cola company.

"Feel fresh! With our new buzz blast cola!"

The bottle's stuck between her boobs.

They're old animal cages.

Yuck! The smell! 

They must've dies in them... 

the poor things. 

Hey! What's that?

A key!

I can't reach it, my hands won't fit through the bars.

I could use somthing smaller and longer to rach them. 

A little closer...

A ha! Gotcha!

CoatHanger

Now that's something I can use.

A coathanger.

There's nothing else useful in here.

It's pretty dark down there.

Wait!

There's something shining down there...

but I can't fit through the gap.

I need something long and wirey to reach it. 

Whoops! Almost dropped it!

I can use this to reach that shiny thing.

It's a small flashlight.

I'll hang onto it, could be useful. 

I don't need this coat hanger anymore.

It's unlocked!

You can keep the chopsticks darling.

Thanks!
ありがとうございました

Mmmm...

That smells delicious!
おいしそう！
Hello there, child. 
こんにちは小さな女の子
You seem lost?
あなたは迷子になっていますか？
Maybe, I don't know?
わからない。
I fell asleep...
私は眠ってしまった
when I woke up I was here.
次に私が学んだことは、私がここで目が覚めたということでした
Do you need anything, my darling?
さて、何か必要な場合は、私に会いに来てください
How about some of those tasty noodles!
それらの麺のいくつかはどうですか
I'm starving!
私はお腹が空いています
It's all yours.

Here, try some.

Mmmmmm, yum!

Excuse me?

Can you tell me where I am?

Huh? Oh, you're in the downtown marketplace.

Do you know how I can get home?

Where are your parents?

I-I'm not sure, I woke up here. 

Maybe you should just wait here.

I'm sure they'll return for you. 

Ok, thanks. 

Say, you haven't found a key, have you?

I dropped it around here somewhere.

Nope, sorry, Mister. 

Just wait here.

I'm sure they will find you.

I-It's an air duct.

Maybe I can crawl through. 

It's pretty dark in there, though.

I'll need some sort of light before I can go in there.

Ok, that's better. 

I hope this is the way home.

Yes?

I found your key, Mister!

Huh? Oh, thank you! 

I thought I'd never find it!

A ha! Caught'ya! I could smell you a mile away!

Oh great, the smoke police. 

So, you gonna tell mom?

No, as usual. 

I can't sleep Sombie.

I told you before, stop calling me that!

Well, what do your friends call you?

Somba. 

Pfft! That's stupid.

I like Sombie better. 

It sounds like you're calling me a "zombie".

Do I look like a zombie to you?

Yeah, when your getting outta the shower. 

Grr! Shut up, Luzia! 

You look like a creepy doll!

Yeah, but you can still cuddle a doll.

I wouldn't want to cuddle a zombie. 

*Sigh* So, why can't you sleep?

I had that dream again....

Again? Which one?

The Chinese markets?

Or that German singing alligator?

*Sigh* Please...

I was trying to forget about that one, that damed song. 

It was the Chinese market one.

You mean the one where I'm like this "ghost-like" thing? 

Yep! 

Doesn't that bother you at all?

Why? It's your dream, after all.

But you're dead. 

It's just a dream Luzia.

Whatever you say, Sombie...

just don't say I didn't warn you. 

You worry too much, besides...

you better get back to bed, mom's gonna be home soon. 

She'll get mad if you're up again.

Besides, it's cold out here. 

Ok, Ok, I'm going inside. 

Good, see you inside. 

Sommmmbieeee?

BobbyPin

What's this?

A Bobby Pin.

I used to pick Sombie's room with these. 

Ewww, there's a hair on it. 

WHy do I feel a sharp pain in my neck?

Weird.

Grr!

*Sigh*

Perfect!

Now I can't get back to sleep! 
今は眠れない！
Better see what Sombie's up to. 
私の妹はどこですか
Hopefully, I can go back to sleep.

Ok...

this is not working! 

WHY CAN'T I SLEEP?!

Oh, yeah! The lights! 

Better turn them off. 

Like duh. 

That was quick, I didn't even leave the bed.

Maybe a fuse or something? 

I know I'm gonna to get in trouble for this...but what the hell.

MOM! MOMMY! THE LIGHT'S BLEW UP! 

M-Mom?

I bet Sombie's just tryin' to scare me again. 

SOMBIE! YOU'RE GONNA GET IT! 

Sombria!?

Fine, I guess I'll just go and fix the lights myself!

I can't sleep.

I hate that dream, so much...

Although, those noodles do sound delicious!

Only my mom's lucky screwdriver, which I don't need. 

Why is it in here?

Does he forget his tools every time he fixes something here?

I always hated this picture.

My bow is so crooked and everything. Where did I get it anyway?

Geez, mom!

I better stay out of her room, she'd kill me. 

Even just peeking in. 

Besides, it's locked

Well, just a peek. She's not gonna mind.

Who am I kidding? She's gonna kill me!

Great! The boby pin broke anyway! 

A photo?

Who drew this? 

I don't need to use it.

My laptop needs to be charged.

Y'know, I think I'll go for a glass of milk.

Well, MOM! I'm just going to the kitchen to get a glass of milk!

Is that okay with you?

Typical eight year old.

Uh, I'm twelve, dumb dumb!

Whatever, just hurry up and get to bed!

Mom's gonna be home any minute now, and you're gonna get it!

Don't worry, I'll just tell her I was having a quick smoke before bed.

If this is some sick joke, I'm telling mom!

If anyone is listening to me right now, I'm using sarcasm!

I would use this mug...

but Sombie's been slobbering all over it.

Yuck! Smells like cigarettes!

Why has mom not noticed it yet?

Haha! The toaster.

I remember when Sombie caught her hands in here.

Twice!

In half an hour!

Ha! She was trying to get her earring!

What an idiot!

I better not.

It's dark enough already. 

Sombie!

Sombria! Open up!

I know you're in there!

Great, I'm gonna have to follow that trail.

I don't need to go to the bathroom.

Gee, I wonder why "assface" gets to stay up so late.

She doesn't even do anything besides stink up the place and be annoying! 

Maybe I should tell mom she's smoking.

But then...she'd probably tell mom about the roach.

I need to find a better home for it besides Sombie's underware draw. 

It's probably cleaner than her uderware. 

Anyways, I better get back to bed. 

I can't believe mom has that stupid cat drawing.

I did that when I was like, three!

I should've drawn a tiger.

Much cooler!

Well, it's a picture after all.

Somehow I don't think mom's gonna like it.

Huh? The picture changed!

There's a new marking on it.

SOMBIE!

L-Luzia?

Y-You need t-to...

Sombria, what happened?

RUN LUZIA! RUN!

Oh no!

So, Luzia...

what are we going to talk about today?

*Shrugs* I dunno.

How about we start with these reoccurring dreams?

Would you like to talk to me about the last one you had?

...No.

Luzia, how can I help you if you're not going to open up to me?

Can I ask you something?

You can ask me anything, Luzia. 

You were diagnosed with a rare but bizarre mental illness, Luzia. That's why you're-

Why am I really here?

All you want to talk about are my dreams...

maybe, it's not the dreams or the illness...

maybe, it's me.

Your dreams drive your illness, Luzia.

I think your sister's death is the key to your problem. 

Sombie's not dead, though.

Luzia, we've been through this. She's dead, you must accept it. 

We need to make some sort of progress if we're going to make you feel better.

F-Fine, I'll accept it then.

Good, we finally made some progress. 

You've finally come to accept your sister's- 

Because they don't help, they make me forget about things.

No, I accept that she is still alive. 

We may have to reduce your dosage, you could be having hallucinations. 

I'll prescribe you with something a little less-

I haven't been taking them...

for weeks now.

You haven't been taking them?

She is alive, it's true.

Luzia, this may be hard for you to understand, but it was you who found her body...

hanging, in her room. 

You're lying! 

The thing is...

It's ok, Luzia. It's-

Do you believe in the afterlife, Mr. Black?

Hmm, what do you mean by that, Luzia?

Like, ghosts, spirits? 

Kinda.

Ghosts can't touch you...hurt you.

A poltergeist, maybe? 

I don't know...

do poltergeist eat?

I don't see the need if they're already spirits of the dead.

Then why does Sombie eat?

Because she eats, a lot!

And just what does she eat, Luzia?

Noodles!

Oh?

Oh, and people!

People? 

Sometimes...

only when she's mad. 

Well, that settles it. I think you're going to have to start taking your medication again.

Trust me, it'll help you, I promise. 

It doesn't help, it makes things worse. I can't even remember the last time I saw you. 

L-Let's try something, Luzia.

An exercise, I want you to find something in this room, any object.

It has to relate to how you feel right now. 

Pick anything you want in this room and bring it to me. 

Once you have an item, bring it to me.

Please, just be careful with the items...

I want to keep everything in its place.

OK.

There's nothing here.

Ick, a brain... 

I better take this, he'll think I'm smart or something. 

DollChoice

Hey! A doll!

Maybe it's just me...

but dolls creep me the heck out! 

So you brought me the doll.

Let's talk about that.

Please, take a seat.

So, why did you pick the doll?

It's cute I guess?

In a creepy sorta way. 

Hmm, I can assure you it means more than just "cute".

This to me, means vulnerability... 

are you feeling fragile, Luzia?

Fragile? What's that supposed to mean?

Did your sister ever "hurt" you, or "touch" you in any wa-

What?! No! 

My mom would never do such a thing!

Besides, mom's never home, she's always working. 

She's a nurse, so she works late. 

What about your sister?

I told you before, I don't have one. 

First it's my mom, and now it's my sister?

Well, Luzia, you did pick the doll. 

I picked it because it was cute. I like dolls! 

Not because I'm vulnerable.

You're holding back, Luzia. 

It's ok to tell me, I want to help you. 

*Sigh* There is one thing...

but I really don't like to talk about it.

I-I watched my sister...die.

Touch you? I knew it! 

I knew you had already come to terms with your sister's death.

No, she didn't "touch" me, she...

did hurt me. 

This is still a breakthrough! How did she hurt you?

She...she said I was adopted. That we're not really sisters...

and mom is not really my mom.

Is that all?!

Sombie! Come on! Show yourself!

Just show yourself!

Luzia, I think we're done here today. 

...please...

I'll have the receptionist book your next appointment and please, take your medication. 

See the lady at the desk on your way out.

ACH_DOLL

Hmm, the brain.

Interesting. 

Why did you pick this?

Because I'm smart! 

It's also all pink and squishy! 

To me it means intellectuality. 

You seem like a smart girl, Luzia. 

Sombie thought so too...

a "smart ass".

*I can see why*

Tell me something, if you're a smart girl...

why do you still insist your sister is still alive?

I-I...

look, I don't want to talk about her anymore. 

We still have another twenty minutes left, Luzia. 

I said, no more. 

Don't do this again, don't waste my time, Luzia.

Remember what happened the last time you did?

...Yes.

Now, can we please get back to your sister-

You can't do that to me anymore. 

D-Do what?

Hurt me...

W-What are you talking about? I don't hurt-

...Touch me.

How dare you! I would never-

The medication helps me forget...remember?

L-Luzia? What's happened to your voice?

I don't think he get's it, Luzia. 

I think it's time we show him... 

what it means to feel "alive".

G-Get the hell away from me! 

I'm sorry, Mr. Black...

I really am.

W-What's that sound?

W_WHAT IS THAT THING! 

That? 

That is Sombria. 

IMPOSSIBLE! 

Told ya so! 

STAY AWAY, PLEASE!

See, she's alive. 

Now do you believe me?

Well? W-Wait! Sombie! 

NO! STAY AWAY!

Sombie! What the heck?! I only meant scare him! 

You may as well have licked the chair clean!

No blood or anything!

Hee wass hurrrrtinnnng youuu, Luzzzzia. 

Please don't put the voice on, it's stupid. 

You're not scary, Sombie. 

Sorry, but I can't stand it! This body aches, I'm always hungry, and the pain...is excruciating! 

I can't live like this.

You're fine, Sombie.

Don't put yourself down.

Do I look fine to you? I'm a hideous creature! 

I don't know if I'm dead or alive?

Well, at least you're out of your room finally.

THIS ISN'T FUNNY! 

Well, it's better than being depressed?

You wouldn't know a thing about being depressed, Luzia! 

Y-You're right, I-I'm sorry, Sombie.

I want to help you. 

You can't, Luzia...

no one can.

Well, I'm here if you want any help.

That's what sisters are for.

Wow Luzia, I can't believe you just said that.

Thanks.

It's okay.

Let's go home.

Oh, that's a shame.

Wait a minute?

What are you doing here?

Just like everyone else.

I've got some issues I need sorting.

What about you darling?

Taking your sister out for lunch?

Don't you have noodles to sell or something?

Don't you have a sister that needs you?

There's nothing else I can do for her. 

She doesn't want my help, anyway. 

That's what they all say.

What do you mean?

Do you think she want's you to ask you for your help?

Heh, but what do I know? 

I'm just an old Lady, after all. 

But you said it yourself...

she can't be changed back.

That doesn't mean she can't be helped...

put yourself in her position, then tell me how you feel.

Then tell me how you would feel?

That word Sombie said before...

depressed.

Gosh!

I don't know why you're seeing this fool! 

I should start my own clinic, and get out of noodles.

Is there a way to get out of here?

I need to help Sombria.

You're twelve, you're better figuring this out than me! 

You're better at figuring this stuff out than me.

Besides, the key to your problem is better off flushed away.

Great, now I can get outta here.

Feeling sick my darling?

You took your time in there.

I-It must have been something I ate for lunch.

Okay dear, see you next time.

I hope I don't see "you" anymore.

Why is this happening, Luzia?!

GO TO HELL, LUZIA!

I WISH YOU WERE CURSED, JUST LIKE ME!

...maybe you're right Sombie. 

I should have been the one that was cursed. 

Well, it's too late, little sister. 

You can't change your mistakes.

...she's right. 

She's getting worse by the day...

and I keep making it worse...

don't worry, Sombria.

I will fix this, I promise. 

Is that the door?

Why is there a hand coming out of the toilet?

It holding a key...

you've got to be kidding me.

he's weird. Still... 

that does sound quite terrifying. 

I'll wash my hands later.

So, where are we going?

Well?

I don't know, Luzia! 

How can you be so calm about this?!

Easy, this has to be a prank!

A prank? You think this is a prank, Luzia?!

WE'RE BEING KIDNAPPED! 

When is that going to sink into that stupid little head of yours?!

Well, what are we going to do about it, then?

The door's locked...

there's no way out. 

Huh? Well that's not good.

Still so chirpy, I don't get you at all. 

Only thing to do is see where they take us. 

Who's ''they''?

I don't know, they were wearing masks.

I thought I saw...

an old-

Hey! Do you hear that?

It sounds like a parade?

Where are we?

It sounds like...

Little Asia!

Little Asia?

Yeah, I can hear the Asian music! 

Weird thing is we don't have any Asian towns near us?

We must be in Little Tokyo.

I don't know. 

Anyway, we need a plan for when that door opens.

I'll kick the guy that opens it and then we make a run for it, ok?

That's a stupid plan, it'll never work. 

Oh, and why not?

Well, in the movies...

the kidnapped people usually fall asleep before they arrive.

In the movies?

Yes, the movies. 

You think this is a movie?!

*Sigh* It'll work, trust me. 

If you say so, sis. 

Okay, let's get ready.

Hopefully, we'll be arriving soon. 

FirstEnter

Well...

it's about time you showed up. 

Hopefully you girls had a smooth ride?

I deeply apologize for the rough transportation... 

You're both probably wanting an explanation for all of this?

Actually, I wanna know why you're naked?

Well, aren't you the mischievous one.

Welcome, to my bathhouse. 

We're fine, thanks. 

I wanna go swimming! 

Shut up, Luzia! Now is definitely not the time to go-

Oh! But where are my manners?

I am Ashina... 

But everybody calls me The Red Witch.

A witch?

Like, pointy hat, warts and, black cats?

Heh, sort of.

Your Luzia, right?

I've heard a lot about you, we're not so different you and I. 

What do you want with us?

Why did you bring us here?

Skipping introductions? 

Very well. 

I only wanted you, Sombria...

Your sister was a bonus that idiot brought along.

What! Why!?

Thing is, you have something that I want, that I need. 

You see, when we can't have what we want in life, we take it.  

And all I wanted was a pair of legs...

A pair of long, beautiful, luscious legs.

To attract the man of my dreams.

I couldn't have what I wanted...

well, not in this world. 

To get what I desired was to make a sacrifice...

I took the legs from my sister, ripped them off of her waist! 

She had all the perfections any girl would ever dream of! 

Especially those long, silky, luscious legs.

but at a cost.

This, this is my prize for my sacrifice! 

As you can see...

this is my curse. 

No way!

W-What do you want with me?

We look very much alike, you and I.

It's uncanny how much we resemble one another...

we are almost, identical.

I would like to offer you a trade...

my body, for yours.

W-What?! No! 

This all could be yours, the bathhouse, the fame, the riches...all of it. Anything you wish.  

She ain't gettin' your stilts, lady!

You better let us go-

Wait, did you say "anything"?

LUZIA!

Sombie, ask for a pony, quickly! 

just ask for a really tall one! 

Ha Ha! Sombria, I love your little sister!

What a sense of humor! 

LUZIA, STOP IT!

Ok, then forget about it, lady! 

Heh, it was just an offer, sweetie. 

And you're more than welcome to say no Sombria.

Then why did you kidnap us?

Funny, I don't remember asking for you to be kidnapped?

I'll make sure to punish whoever did that to you. 

Oh, and Sombria...

think about my offer. 

I don't want to think about it!

I just want us to go home!

Then, let's got you both home.

I'll arrange a ride back for both of you, but in the mean time...

feel free to enjoy the buffet, you must be hungry. 

You got a buffet?!

All you can eat.

Ok, I'm sold.

C'mon, Sombie! Let's go chow down! 

If only you girls knew...

Did I say you could come in? 

Surely a mother can visit her daughter?

You are no mother of mine.

You gave me this wretched curse, and destroyed Tena's-

And you took my daughters for greed over some stupid man. 

â€¦why are you here?

Just a friendly word of caution.

What?

Beware of the child.

I know who she is!

Well, you thought wrong, you old crone.

I will finally be free.

*Tisk, tisk* My poor daughter, I'm sorry...

but you will never be free, just like your friend, Tanto.

I'm always hungry.

I know you are.

I can't just stand here with an empty stomach!

I'm gonna go snoop around.

No, you stay right here! 

Sorry ''mom'', I can't do that.

I wont go too far, ok?

*Sigh* You're not going to listen to me anyway.

I'll bring you back a donut or something.

Hey Sombie!

What Luzia?

Can I have one of your hair pins?

Why?

My fringe is loose.

It looks fine to me. 

My back fringe, duh.

Whatever. Here, just leave me alone for a while.

Not now, Luzia. 

If she was a spider, she'd be called a mommy Long Legs!

ENOUGH, LUZIA!

I am not in the mood for this right now. 

Pfft, fine. Hey, Sombie-

STOP CALLING ME THAT! 

Ok, yeash! Sorry! 

I didn't mean to make you upset.

...No it's okay. *Sigh*

I just want to go home.

So, who are you?

*Sigh* This is why I hate kids.

My name is Nikuya, but the witch calls me ''The Butcher''.

I thought you were the chef?

I don't cook, well, not anymore.

Everything here is raw.

Oh, like sushi?

*Sigh* NO, not like sushi!

Do you know what witches eat?

I think my mom read me a book on that.

they eat gingerbread houses.

Kid, look, this isn't exactly a safe place for you to be in. 

People, especially humans, go missing round here...

just be careful.

Yes! Some delecious noodles! 

I knew there was something to eat around here.

I'll just take the chopsticks, yuck.

It's locked.

Hey a freezer!

I'd hate to get locked in there.

Excuse me, Mr. Butcher. 

Have you met the lady on the wall? 

Wait! How do you know about her?!

I used the knife you gave me to cut a hole in the wallpaper.

*Sigh*Why do I always end up in stupid-

I should've just gutter her like a fish...

but no, I gave her the damn knife! I could been somewhere far away from this shi-

*Sigh* Listen kid, stay away from her...

she's nothing but trouble. 

Too late, Mr. Butcher.

*Sigh*Well, last time I played her little game she wanted an object or something?

Can't you just tell me how to get outta here?

What if the witch finds out? You're not the only one who'll be gutted...again. 

Just do what the lady wants, she can take the blame. 

If you wanna know more about the item to give her just bring it to me first. 

I can shed some info on it for you. 

Thanks, oh, and by the way...

where's your face?

It's in my car, why? 

I think you're lying. 

Everyone should have a face!

Do I need one? 

I'm not even human.

Then, what are you?

Kid, you ask way too many questions. 

Well, how about one more?

Can I have that big, sharp knife?

A little girl with a big knife?

I just got a chill down my spine, and I don't even have one. 

Oh, right, no. It's mine

Can't have everything we want, sorry. 

Just like me. 

Well, what do you want? A face?

I wouldn't say no to one, could use a face lift. 

Hey! Mr. Butcher!

I have a surprise for you!

I found you a face!

Really? Who'd you steal it off? 

You didn't cut someone's face-

Ta da!

Oh...a mask. 

So, what do you think?

Honestly, it doesn't look half bad!

Thanks kid!

So, can I have that knife now?

Sure, go nuts! 

Just be responsible with it...

you don't wanna go round killin' anyone with it or anything. 

Can you tell me a little more about this item?

Uh, I already know that.

Looks like my lunch, a dead traditional koi fish.

That's a spider lily, it resembles death, 

Cool name, but why is so dangerous?

It's used to kill spirits and demons in the afterlife... 

and I've died far too many times to be touched by that thing for my liking. 

Whoa! Is death painful?

Is death painful?

*Sigh* I just found something even more painful. 

Well wadda ya know!

A pair of chopsticks?

Apart from them being very useful with cooking and eating, they are basically just to sticks.

No.

Great! Now leave me alone!

As I said be for, I'm already dead! 

NOW I'M JUST A HEAD! YOU LITTLE DIP-

Sorry about that, but what the hell happened here?

*Sigh* ...She did this.

the lady who's not so on the wall. 

She broke free. 

How? 

Listen kid, there's no time to waste...

she's after someone named Sombria. 

That's my sister!

Find her and get out while you still can! 

She will kill you both if you stay here. 

But I need that head you're wearing!

Listen kid, just get out! She is coming for you! 

Look, I'm going to find Sombria...

just hang in there, and try not to lose your head- I mean her head!

W-Wah? No way!

It's alive?

It? 

I-U, uh- 

"It" is not my name...

I am known as "The Lady On The Wall".

And whom do I have the pleasure of meeting?

What is your name, my dear?

I-It's Luzia.

Hmm, strange name for a young girl.

My mom said it's a bright name.

Such a dark place to be in for one with such a..."bright" name. 

Tell me Luzia, why are you here?

We were kidnapped by the witch in the bath and-

We?

There's someone with you?

Yeah, my sister, Sombria.

Heh...

How ironic, the opposites. Light and Dark. 

Tell me, did the witch make either of you an offer?

Well, not to me...

she did to Sombie though. 

I knew it! Trying to escape your wretched curse now, are you?

I don't think so, we're just waiting for our ride home.

She's not letting you leave, Luzia...

but I may be able to help you, both. 

Okay, how?

I'll make you a deal...

You bring me something that I wan't. and I'll tell you how to escape, deal?

Okay, that sounds fair.

However, if you bring me something that I don't want...

then you will nourish my withing body with yours, deal?

Wait, what?! No way, lady! 

I could just eat you now? Save me the rouble of waiting. 

But I'm feeling generous today, so, bring me something of...

Usefulness.

Death.

Tradition.

Oh, would you look at that!

Such a lifeless, greasy body. A dead fish...

Looks like you made the right choice. 

I shall help you, but just this once. 

You need to find the secret passage somewhere in the bathing room.

You'll need this tile plus one other to activate the passage.

You should hurry if you want to save your sister...

and...I'm also getting quite hungry.

*Tisk,tisk* You dissapoint me, Luzia. 

But you won't dissapoint me stomach.

Such a deadly flower, such beauty. 

The table is broken.

Hey! S-She's...gone!

Not good!

Wait, what's this?

You...took my legs, my looks, my...life. I will never forgive you for what you have done to me! You shall all choke on your thick greedy blood. 

I need to warn Sombie.

Oh my gosh!

What the hell happened here?

We were literally gone for a few hours...

w-who did this?

but I have a feeling we're about to find out. 

So, where is the head?

I think it's in the secret bathroom.

I'll go check there, you look around here. 

We'll meet up in the sauna room if anything happens. 

Be careful.

How does she vanish like that?

So cool!

I don't think anyone would mind me looking.

This should come in handy.

Hey, what's this?

It smells lovely.

Even though a wicked witch runs this place...

she still finds the time to recycle. 

Great! We're locked in.

Maybe there's another way out.

I can't leave now.

Not without the head.

RedWitch

Luzia, I'm glad you could join us. 

Wait! Stop!

You let her go!

LUZIA! JUST RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!

You're not going anywhere. 

I need you both for my plan of redemption! 

I'm not leaving without my sister!

Luzia, I love your bravery.

But seriously, what are you going to do?

Something you wouldn't like.

Maybe something like this?

*Gasp* SOMBRIA!!!

Whoops, sorry Luzia.

But she's mine now.

WHAT DID YOU DO TO SOMBRIA!

Something that was done to me, a long time ago.

I will fuse my spirit with hers and leave this forsaken world! 

You will stay here with the others. 

CHANGE HER BACK!

There's no going back! I am tired of having to live in those cold salty waters for too long! 

She is no longer your sister, Luzia!

You're wrong...

Luzia! Hurry!

We can escape through this pipe in the water.

Sombie...

W-What has she done to you?

You look, different-

I KNOW, LUZIA!

I-I, know.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

Please, just don't say anything right now...

leave me alone. 

But you always want to be alone!

Well, I can't be alone when you're around!

Why is this happening to me?

What did I do to deserve this?

This must be the way out of here.

But it's locked.

I'll have to find a key.

Just because I'm dry, doesn't mean I want to jump back in.

More dead animal cages floating in there. 

There's a door on the other side.

I don't think I can jump that gap. 

Maybe, I could make a bridge.

I hope this holds.

I don't want to get wet again.

Eww gross!

Sewer water, yuck! 

Hey! There's something shiny in there.

Hmm, I ain't sticking my hand in there. 

I'll need to fish it out somehow. 

FindMetalPole

Hopefully that shiny thing is made out of metal. 

Well, it worked!

It's a metal pipe.

Maybe I can find a use for it.

I could use this plank of wood to make a bridge. 

It looks pretty old though. 

I just hope it doesn't break.

There's nothing else in there.

There's something glimmering in there...

but I ain't sticking my hand in to find out. 

I'll need something long to reach it. 

FindString

This'll save me using my hand.

Some fishing line? 

What kind of fish would you catch down here?

Okay, let's make a fishing pole.

There's some sort of metal cable floating in the water.

I could fish it out if I had a fishing pole.

I still can't reach it with the pole...

but I could make a fishing pole if I had some string...

and a hook. 

SewerKey

There you are! Mr. Gate Key! 

Let's get out of here.

Sombie! I found the key to the gate.

We can get outta here!

Just go without me, Luzia...

leave me here. 

Pfft, I knew you were going to say that!

Look Sombie, I don't know what the witch lady did to you...

but we can fix it, we can't just give up.

There must be a way to change you back!

I-I don't know, Luzia. 

You won't unless you try, Sombie. 

But the witch, she's dead... 

how are we going to change me back?

Maybe someone else knows? Lets go ask around! 

Ok, and thanks, Luzia. 

I should say it a lot more but it's hard, y'know? 

It's fine, Sombie.

I don't know, Luzia. 

*Sigh!* Fine...

you stay here, I'll come get you when I find someone that can help you. 

I really don't wanna go back in there...

but I need to help Sombie. 

I should look around for some answers first. 

Mmm smells delicious!

How much for a bowl of noodles?

3 coins a bowl! 

Would you like some?

Sorry, but I wish I had some money...

I'm so hungry. 

Sorry, little lady! 

No dough, no noodles! 

Who you callin' little?!

You're shorter than me! 

So cliché.

It's a laundromat.

I could use some clean clothes right about now.

Explaination

I'm looking for someone who can help my-

Sorry, little one. I'm really busy with this mess. 

Do you know anyone who can help me? 

I think my sister is cursed.

Hmm, you should find Yoko. 

She's an expert on such things. 

Yoko?

Where can I find her?

Well, my friend usually sees her in the laundromat, washing her blankets. 

But for some reason, some wise-ass locked the gate to the laundromat and has the key. 

Explaination2

What's wrong with your sister?

I think she's sick?

Oh my, that's not good. 

What kind of sickness does she have?

Something that makes you pale, with really long arms-

That sounds more like a curse to me.

I thought so. 

You didn't meet a witch by chance? Did you?

Maybe.

Well, the only person I know that could help you is Yoko. 

She's also known as the "Noodle Lady".

Noodle lady?

Yeah, she's like an expert on curses n' stuff.

So where can I find her?

She's usually in the laundromat, washing her underwear. 

Really? I need to was my undies too! 

Probably the rest of my clothes too. 

No offence, but you smell like you need a wash in general.

Where have you been? Ugh! 

It's not like I went swimming in a sewer or anything.

Did you?

That's gross! 

Ok, seeya! 

Find the noodle lady. 

She can help your sister.

Great, it's locked!

Maybe someone here has a key?

FindMeAnApple

Excuse me!

Could you help me and my sister out?

Can you help me out? 

This bozo won't give me any more fried fish, and I'm starving! 

If you eat anymore, you'll put me out of business!

You're worse than that Tanto guy! 

Look, mister...

Give me one, and I'll show you.

Nice try!

Maybe you should eat some fruit for once! Much healthier! 

Ya know, I could eat an apple right about now.

I'll tell you what, you find me an apple and I'll give you the gate key to the laundromat, deal?

*Sigh* Fine...

but if you don't, I'll make you choke on that apple. 

It's a deal, then! 

Thanks for the apple.

Huh? A sign?

Oh, awesome! Thanks!

Now, your end of the deal!

Oh, right. Here, take this. 

You can unlock the gate to the laundromat with it.

I better head to the bathhouse.

I said I'll do this on my own.

Well, I figured you might need the key to get in.

We ain't gonna find the witch's head standing here.

Hey...

I've been expecting you...

And I've been expecting you...

old woman. 

You don't even know who I am, do you?

No, no I don't. 

Do you remember me? 

Wait a hoot picking toot! 

You're the noodle lady in my dreams! 

Oh my!

You're all wet and smelly!

Why don't you call your sister...

I'll pay for your closed to be cleaned. 

Wow, really? Thank you that's real nic-

Wait! How do you know that I have sister?

I know a lot about you, Luzia. 

I never asker for your help!

I think you were just about to.

You're not another witch are you?

C'mon, young one...

lets get you out of those wet clothes. 

But what will I wear? I can't just stand here naked?

I wouldn't worry about that...

there's only one other lady who uses this laundromat...

and she only comes in on Tuesdays. 

So tell me girls...

lovely weather we're having, isn't it?

Not a cloud in the night sky.

It's a little cold, to be honest. 

Huh...

must be Tuesday. 

Washing Machine

Oh? You girls are back?

You look surprised to see us?

Well with the Lady running around, I was sure you'd be done for.

Are you spying on us?

Word travels fast around the slums, hun. 

C'mon, don't bullshit me, old lady!

Luzia! Watch your language!

Hey! You're not in charge of me anymore!

Monsters can't be babysitters!

Ouch.

Shut up, Luzia! You're the real monster!

Oh how I've missed this.

How could you miss this? 

I have to live with this little brat every day! 

I look like a freak because of her! 

I still remember when my daughters used to get along so well.

All they ever do now is fight for centuries...

just like you two. 

Wait! Centuries?

How old are you?

How old do you think I am, Luzia? 

A hundred, maybe?

Huh, must be the hair.

Eighty? 

You can keep guessing, you'll never get it. 

How can the witch- I mean, your daughter, look as old as me?

We're in the spirit world, young lady. 

Age means nothing here. 

So we don't age? 

Really?

You could be a thousand years old and have the complexity of a child. 

We are stuck in an endless limbo, until me move on to the planes above. 

However, there are those who wish to return to where they once came...

just like Ashina. 

Wait, you can go back?!

We can go home?!

There is ways to do it, but it takes a lot of complex-

C-Can we fix my condition, first?

Yes, of course.

Now that we have my daughter's head...

I can use her blood to make a cure for the curse. 

All you need to do is drink it.

It'll take some time to work but once it does, it should change you back to your old self. 

So how does it work?

It'll break the loop of the curse, what it does is-

Just get to the point, old lady! 

This is a complicated curse Luzia.

Once Sombria drinks the antidote, she will have only 3 days to return home.

Otherwise...you will be stuck in the curse's loop forever.

For ever?

You mean Sombie, right?

S-Sure. 

Just remember...

that when the time comes, you will have to make a choice. 

Just tell me what I have to do.

Heh, just drink this and go home.

That is all.

Wait, really?

That's it?

No magic spells, voodoo or rituals? 

That sounds too easy.

It does, doesn't it. 

I can assure you that it is much more complicated behind the veil.

Once you both return home...

it shall be broken.

So how do we get home?

We were kidnapped in the back of a truck!

I have no idea where we are or what this "spirit place" is?

I know someone who can take you as far as the countryside.

I can arrange travel as far as the country side but from there you will need to return on your own.

There's a convenient bus route that can get you as far as the Chikara express train line. Here are some tickets for the bus and the train.  

Now get some rest, you leave in the morning. 

Oh, before I forget...

did you remember to lock the bathhouse doors when you were done?

U-Uh, whoops!

NoodleCutscene

You were kidnapped?

Yeah, and they beat up Sombie too! 

That settles it, she has gone too far this time! 

Uh, who has?

Well, it's about time I introduced myself.

Yes, where are they?

I am Yokona Kagami...

But everyone just calls me Noodle Lady.

Let me guess, it's because you sell noodles?

I own the Ramen shop next door. 

I see you both have met my daughter, Ashina.

The witch is your daughter?

This is perfect! You can help Sombie! 

Right?

Hmm, by the looks of things it may be too late for her, Luzia. 

You mean I'll be stuck like this forever?

My dear, I hate to be the one to tell you this but, you're dead. 

I'M DEAD?!

But she's standing right there! 

Sombria, place your hand over your heart.

Do you feel a beat?

THERE'S NO BEAT! I'M DEAD!!

WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO ME?!

By the looks of things you're now a Yokai Sombria.

What's a Yokai?

A yokai, a ghost, spirit, whatever you want to call it...

well actually, maybe poltergeist is probably a better term. 

It seems Ashina wanted something from you but what exactly?

S-She wanted to swap bodies.

Hmm, looks like it didn't go all to plan. 

Something went wrong as you've turned into one of us. 

One of you? You still look human! 

I look like a hideous creature!

You just look like a human, only with long arms and pale skin.

And no legs, what happened to those?

Anyway, you look fine, Sombie. 

Where is Ashina now?

She's dead, I think.

Her head was floating in the bath.

Dead?! Ha! Serves her right! 

Wow really? I'd really hate to have you as a mom. 

I think Sombie killed her. 

Well this is certainly some good news! 

Good news?

We may be able to reverse the curse.

Reverse the curse? How?

All we need is some of Ashina's blood. 

So if you both are able to retrieve her head then-

Um, how about NO!

I never want to set foot back in that place again!

Don't you want to help your sister?

I do, but isn't there another way?

I'll go.

Wait, Sombie...

You've done enough, Luzia. 

I need to fix this myself. 

I love it when sisters squabble.

Don't you, Luzia?

Yeah, whoopie. 

What are you waiting for?

Go after her.

She obviously doesn't want my help.

They never do...

so why wait for an invitation?

Huh, you're right, old noodle lady. 

Besides, I've probably pissed her off enough for one day. 

Here's the spare key to the bathhouse, I keep it incase of emergencies. 

Thanks. 

Good luck, little one. You're gonna need it. 

So explain to me again...

why are we riding with the door open? Isn't it a little dangerous?

Just look at that view! 

Look at the never-ending line of fences!

It's breathtaking...

It's nauseating, I think I'm gonna *ugh*...

the smell of cows isn't helping. 

Ha! They smell better than you right now!

*Sniff* I don't notice anything? 

It's a proven fact you can't smell yourself.

No it isn't.

Then how come you can't smell your own farts?

You're an idiot.

It's true!

Everybody else can smell mine, except me.

That's because you leave the room right after you do one!

Nah, I think it's fart magic.

Speaking of magic...

did you take that magic potion?

It's not a magic potion, it's an antidote...

and yes I did. 

I would have taken it when I got home.

Didn't the old noodle lady said it would go off in a few days?

Yes but it shouldn't take us that long to get home, I think?

Two days. I remember her saying something about that this morning...

and some mumbo jumbo about breaking the "loop".

Loop? What loop?

Loop of the curse, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. 

Actually, there was one thing she did say before we left. 

T-That I should...

*ugh* enjoy my time with you. 

Ha! That's easy! What's not to enjoy? 

I'm always fun, baby! 

Whatever. 

And I'm smoke free! 

Rubbing it in, huh? 

You know what? We're not fighting, right now. 

she was right.

This is kinda enjoyable.

*Deep breath* I can't get enough of that stank, cow fart infested air! 

Annnd there it goes. Enjoyment gone. 

Heh, you're a weird girl Luzia.

So much for the truck ride.

Just be thankful it got us this far. 

Where are we anyway?

It looks like a bus stop. 

Congratulations, Luzia...

you won a cookie. 

Wait, really? 

Gimme! I'm starving! 

All I ate was a dead fish I found in the buffet! 

Please tell me that didn't happen?

I stole it from that faceless guy. 

I can't believe we're even related.

I was being sarcastic about the cookie, Luzia. 

Damn.

This bus sure is slow.

Well, I'm bored. 

Oh no, you're not wandering off again!

Please?

The last time you wondered off I turned into this hideous creature!

Do you really think I'm going to let that happen again?

This time, you stay here...

I'm gonna go see if I can find someone  around here, maybe they'll have some food...I'm hungry too. 

You too?!

J-Just wait here, I can smell something...

Call out when the bus arrives. 

Huh, so this is what it feels like. 

Hey! A mushroom! 

I could eat it.

If I were desperate, looks poisonous.

Mushroom2

I hope this helps her.

Here you go, Sombie. 

This'll keep you dry. 

Please tell me you didn't just do that.

A leaf? This is going to keep me dry?

I feel silly.

You look silly. 

So, find anything in there?

Nothing out of the ordinary.

Heh, after everything we've seen what is ordinary anymore.

We should probably stand under the bus shelter.

I like the rain.

It's nice.

It is peaceful, but we're probably gonna catch a cold.

what will happen with us, when this is all over?

I, I don't know...

it'll all go back to normal, I guess. 

Even us?

The fighting, the arguing, stuff like that?

Oh! Well, we don't have to...

it all depends. 

On what?

On how much you owe me after this.

I have a feeling that I'm never gonna hear the end of this once we get home. 

Oh, you better believe it sister. 

Fantastic! 

Yep! I'm gonna remind you all the time, about how you saved my life.

So, you're not mad at me anymore?

I was never mad at you, Luzia.

Once you get older things become more complicated...

sometimes, I wish I could be as young as you again. 

We can't go back...

we need to keep moving forward...

and if I stay mad at you...

I won't be going anywhere. 

I get what you mean. 

I thought you never would...

Just promise me one thing. 

Please, quit smoking. You're stinking up the whole house! 

Heh, we'll see, Luzia.

H-Hey! Is that the bus?

ACH_NEIGHBOR_SOMBIE

Where's the bus?

It hasn't arrived yet?

Nope. 

After everything we've seen, what's ordinary anymore?

Saving won't help you now.

Why have you come here, young Luzia?

Because I'm hungry.

Besides that, I mean why are you really here. 

We're stuck while wating for the bus to take us home...

but I'm still hungry. 

The why is your sister here?

How do you-

I am Wiji! 

I am the spirit of the forest! 

I have seen many things in my time amongst the trees...

but I must admit, I'd never thought I'd see you again.

Again?

What do you mean again?

Hmm, it seems like you have forgotten...

such a strange anomaly. 

Tell me, are you planning on breaking your "loop"?

Enough with this loop business! 

First, the noodle lady, now Sombri-

Noodle Lady?

Yes, the old woman. I can't seem to remember her name though.

Yoko, something. 

Yokona Kagami. 

Yeah that's it!

Seems like their plan didn't work after all. 

Young Luzia, you must listen to me very carefully...

...To end it all.

Wait, what does that mean? I'm gonna die?! 

We will see, young Luzia. Good luck. 

Wait, before I go...

why does everyone loves noodles so much? 

B-Because they're delecious! 

Do you know what makes them more delecious?

Wild mushrooms.

Here, take this. It'll give your noodles a bit of a kick in flavor! 

Mushroom3

This should help Sombie.

To Forrest

SombriaDeer

Oh!

Thank god, it's you! 

I thought you were some kind of monster for a second.

Sooo hungry!

I'm so hungry, it hurts!

Sombie?

The pain, the hunger...

p-please, help me.

O-Ok...

just wait right here. 

I'll find you something to eat.

*Ugh* Hurry! 

Please help Luzia.

Mushroom4

Maybe she could eat this.

Mushroom5

Well, it's better than nothing.

Please...

Bring me more.

Thank you, Luzia. 

I feel much better, much...stronger. 

But, you shouldn't have left the bathhouse.

Luzia, you are in great *Ugh* dange- *Ugh*

AHh!

Huh? What's going on?

Oh, my, GOSH!

I can see my own butt!

Luzia! What is happening?!

I have absolutely no idea, Sombie. 

Hang on a second.

I think I can fix my-

OH NO!

THAT POOR DEER!

What happened?!

Uh...I think you had Bambs for lunch Sombie.

I-I did this?

What is wrong with me?

Look Sombie, we should really be heading back to the bus stop.

I'll wait for you there.

I can't just leave her like this.

I need to help Sombie first.

To Noodle Hut

To Forest Entrance

ForestNoodles

No way...

There's a noodle house in the middle of the forest?!

I must be dreaming...

or just really hungry. 

Sorry, I don't mean to be rude...

But what are you?

Mudo no talk! 

Mudo eating! 

So, your name is Mudo?

*Munch* Yes. *Munch*

Mudo will give girl something if you bring Mudo...

mushroom, for Mudo's noodles. 

I'm sorry, but my sister ate all the mushrooms I could find.

Sad Mudo. 

*Munch, munch, munch*

UseMushroom

I have something for you.

Ta-da!

Mmm, mushroom!

It's a, really big leaf?

Special big leaf. *Munch*

Hey there little guy.

Little? I'm not little! 

Everyone is too big!

Huh? I guess you're right. 

So, why is little girl here in the woods?

For the noodles, duh.

What is duh noodles?

What's in the bowl! You adorable little thing, you! 

What's your name, little guy?

Everyone just calls me Little Jacket.

No problem, LJ. 

You're just so cute! 

I could just take you home! 

Hmm, maybe I could-

I-I'm fine, thank you strange girl! 

MmmNoodlesAgain

One bowl please!

Hello, young one. 

You're a little far in the woods to be-

I said, one bowl please!

Well, you must be hungry.

I am.

Then please, take a bowl of noodles. 

That was good!

In exchange, could I ask a favor? 

Sure!

Could you please take a bowl and place it by the shrine...

it's for someone, special.

Thank you, young one.

TrainCutscene

Now this is the way to travel!

A truck, a bus, now a train?!

What's next?

An airplane?!

Nope! Forget that!

Why? What's the matter?

Afraid of heights?

I'm not worried about being up in the sky.

I used to have dreams about being on a plane.

What happened?

Well, I went to the bathroom...

and when I cam back everyone was gone! 

Everyone, it was just me. 

That's a pretty crazy dream. 

That's all I can think about right now!

Remember when uncle Robert tried fixing mom's microwave?

He forgot to unplug it.

Heh, some engineer he is...to bad he disappeared. 

Whatever happened to aunt Claire and cousin Mark?

She dies, Luzia. Mark, I have no clue, to be honest with you. I think he went to a foster home. 

Really? Why didn't he come live with us?

You're already a handful.

Besides, I think it's for the best...

I couldn't imaging the amount of mental problems that boy would have with all that's happened to him. 

Yeah, it's pretty sad...

*Sigh* I miss home.

So do I.

I miss mom too.

Pfft! I don't.

She was never home.

I get that being a nurse is hard work...

but we need attention too! 

What's with you, Luzia? 

These things shouldn't matter to a twelve year old. 

You don't seem like yourself anymore.

I don't even feel like myself...

I feel as if this has all happened before...

like I'm living someone else's life, y'know? 

I'm not me. 

You get what I mean?

I do...

I haven't felt myself since the kidnaping. 

I guess we share the same feelings.

You know what else is weird, though?

Where the heck is everyone?

The train's empty! 

There was no one on the bus either.

I'm gonna take a look around.

Okay, I'll take a look too.

If something happens, we'll meet up in the bathroom.

Ok, we'll-

The bathroom?

For privacy. 

Don't want anything else going astray now, don't we?

Ok, just make sure you're not actually using it when I come in. 

For crying out loud, Luzia. 

Who's crying, now?

SombieTrainBathroom

JESUS! SOMBIE!

You scared the hell outta me!

I thought you weren't scared of anything?

Only by spontaneous surprises!

I'll remember to leave a sign on the door next time.

So, did you find anything?

I met the train driver.

What did he say?

Just some really weird stuff.

Well what?

Do you think this is all a dream?

A dream?

Am I really Luzia?

Only for as long as I've know you.

You're sounding really weird right now, Luzia. 

There's something not right in the back of my mind...

I'm just not sure what it is...

like we're being set or something. 

C'mon, cheer up, Luzia. 

We need to make it home! 

Let's stay focused.

I'll go talk to the driver.

You check the back of the train. 

Oh, I also found this keycard...

not sure what it's for, it didn't work on any of the doors...

maybe you can find a way to use it.

Exit Bathroom

I can't turn back now.

TrainNoodles

Wait a minute, what are you doing here?!

Why are you following us?

Am I following you? I can travel too, y'know. 

I'm just visiting an old friend in the city. 

Yeah right, like I'd believe that! 

You don't look very pleased to see me, hmm?

I'm just worried about Sombie. The creepy killer lady is after her! 

Oh? 

She may even kill her.

Not unless I can help it!

Hmm, just be careful, Luzia. You're life is worth far more than your sister's

What?! Mine is worthless without hers! 

I need to find her.

You need to stop, Luzia.

but I know all about your little plan daughter. 

I'll be waiting.

Hey! It's you!

Yes it is I! Little Jacke...

Could you help me?

*Sigh* What does little girl want?

Do you know a way to unlock this door?

Maybe...

I need a keycard to do that.

I can crawl through the vent and unlock it from the other side. 

Wait! How did she escape?!

I left the bathhouse door open.

whoops.

StretchDies

Stretch!

T-That, woman, s-she did this...

came out of n-nowhere...

ripped the trolley r-right of my head.

Stretch, is there anything I can do to help you?

Anything?!

S-She's after s-someone named...

Sombria. 

Which way did she go?

S-She went into the secret carriage.

p-press the button, on t-the wall. Then, t-the gate. *...*

Stretch...

I-I'm so sorry.

I have to find Sombria. 

T-That woman s-said she was after...

Y-You.

I'm very sorry Stretch.

I must go.

I-It's okay L-Luzia.

Y-You g-gggggg....uhhh...

Stretch!!!

I'm so sorry.

This must be the control switch for the door.

Keycard required.

Great! Where am I going to find a keycard?

The door won't budge!

It must work electronically.

Maybe, there's a switch somewhere.

There are no slots to insert the card.

It must be on the other side of the door.

It's a small duct.

I could get into the other room through there.

Only if I were smaller.

*Whistling*

Little Jacket wonders, what Mudo is doing?

Is this what I need?

It looks like it could work.

Little Jacket will try this card.

Wait here.

Open sesame!

Gosh! Thank you! You adorable little thing!

Little Jacket will close the door if you say that again.

Whoops! I mean, thank you!

What the hell is that!

I'm sorry little girl, no passengers allowed back here.

Who are you?

Me? N-No one ever takes notice of me.

Everyone just calls me Stretch.

I just deal with the passenger's luggage.

But where are all the passengers?

I-I don't know. I'm not permitted to leave this room.

How long have you been here?

W-Well, as long as I can remember.

Why do you want to know Miss....

Luzia, my name is Luzia.

P-Pleased to meet you Luzia.

Please, there's no need to be shy.

I-I'm sorry.

I don't mean to be shy.

It's just, I-I've heard a lot about you.

Tell me, are you still trying to break the curse?

You mean the loo...wait!

How do you know about that?!

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you upset.

Please, tell me what you know about me.

I-I can't.

All I can say is that old lady said a lot about you.

She also said bad things may happen if I talk to you.

Please forgive me.

Bad things!

You're literally a walking head!

Bad hit you a long time ago pal!

I'm sorry.

I'll just hide in the baggage compartment, and be out of your way.

Wait! ...no...

Great! I feel like jerk!

This is a travel point!

Travel to any section on the train.

This must be the switch.

This room...

I've been here before.

A keycard?

There's a note here too.

Why am I on this train? What happened? Where's Sombria?

Where this train is taking me?

It's been three days! I am still stuck in this room!

Why won't they let me leave?

First the truck, the bathhouse, the forest and now this?

What does this all mean!?

D-Did I write this?

Room2

This room feels colder.

Probably forgot to close the window.

A note?

Why can't I wake up?

I can't breathe!

The window is open, but I can't escape!

Maybe I can't leave?

What is stopping me?

Is it...Sombria?

I don't remember writing this?

Room3

This room feels warmer.

It smells like, burnt leather.

A burnt note?

It's time.

It's time to end this mess.

The loop must be broken!

I can't go through all of this again!

The Old Lady has to go!

The one who starts the loop...

Is the one that ends it.

Don't hesitate...

GustophLuzia

Excuse me, Mr. Gustoph?

Well, if it isn't little Luzia!

What can I do for you?

I'm wondering if you had seen my sister?

Hmm, I dunno. What does she look like?

A tall, ghost-ish looking girl with long arms!

That is the most freakish description I've ever heard!

But yes, she did come through here.

Lookin' for you as a matter of fact!

Did she say where she was going?!

She said she was going back to her seat to wait for you.

But that's impossible!

I would have seen her!

Maybe you walked straight past her, without noticing?

N-No, I don't think so.

Nothing ever gets past me!

And nothing gets past Gustoph too.

Because he takes up the entire doorway!

HA HA HA!

Are you sure you saw her?

I am sure, little one.

A ghoulish girl with long arms.

Goulish?

Yes, goulish...or ghost-ish.

Something like that.

She did seem quite happy to see me though.

I think we both are.

Before you go, could you please check on my buddy Stretch?

Haven't heard from him in a while now.

If you haven't hurt his feelings already!

I-I think I did.

Where does he hide?

He should be in the luggage compartment somewhere.

Always waiting to take someones luggage.

The poor guy.

Okay, I'll go find him.

MeetGustoph

Sorry to interrupt.

But can...

Do do do do...Oh!

Hello there, little one!

What are you?

Who, me?

Well, I'm the guy who drives the train!

And what I wanna know is...

How did you get in here?

I found a keycard in the bed carriage.

That's where I left the darned keycard!

Excuse me but, who are you?

They call me Gustoph!

And you must be Luzia?

How do you know my name?!

I know everything!

Plus, it's in the passengers log book.

Gotta keep a head count on all who ride the rails!

Even if hey don't have a head!

How many people are on the train?

Hmm, let me see...

Just one!

Just one!?

But what about my sister?!

Your sister?

You only said how many people, little one.

She's a person too, ya know!

Ho Ho! I'm sure she was!

So, are you on holiday?

No, but I would need one after all this.

Been in a bit of a pickle have we Missy?

You can say that again.

But, we're finally on our way home to end all of this mess.

Well, I'm glad it all worked out for you.

Sure thing, little one.

Where are the rest of the passengers?

Ha Ha! The rest of the passengers!?

Why, they're all around you!

Can't you see them?

Well, no I can't.

They're probably just shy...or...

Maybe...they're scared of something.

Scared? Of who?

You'd best be gettin' back to your cabin young Missy.

Once we're in the tunnel of sorrows, you don't wanna be wonderin' round.

But come see me later! If you're still alive, that is!

Alive?

H-Hey, are you okay?

What home...

Our home.

We don't have a home, Luzia.

Of course we do!

Please don't give up on me now!

Luzia, answer me something.

What do you remember about mother?

Well, not much.

She was never around.

I guess she was too busy working at the hospital.

Luzia...we don't have a mother.

W-What do you mean?

S-She died over a year ago.

I've been lying about her coming home late.

That's the reason I've been sending you to bed early.

B-But her car?!

I hear her pull up every night!

That was my boyfriend.

I've been lying to you this whole time!

I don't know who to trust anymore.

For the first time in my life...

...I feel empty.

Luzia...I-I...

Little one!

Come here quick!

Stop listening to the lies!

Lies?

Sorry little one!

But I could not help over hearing your conversation.

What's it matter anyway...

You don't believe that garbage do you?!

What did I say earlier? Hmm?

U-Uh...I forgot.

Well at least we're out the other end.

End of what?

Ho Ho! The tunnel!

I see the tunnel of sorrows has affected your mind somehow?

The tunnel of sorrows?

When the train passes through the tunnel your worst doubts emerge.

The tunnel shows you the worst possible things that could happen to you.

So it was all a dream?

Well, sort of, my tiny friend.

More like a mirage.

So...none of it was real?

See, that's the thing, it could be real.

If you want it to be real then it will become real.

Fire away little Missy!

What do you see when you go through the tunnel?

Y-Ya know...nobody has ever asked me that before.

What I saw...was me crashing this train...

...Killing every passenger.

...Except me.

Is that what happened to you?

I should have slowed down...

That corner, the ice...

H-How do you know this?

This is going to sound strange.

But, I remember.

I remember being a passenger on this train when it crashed.

I just can't remember why I was on this train.

Then I must say, I deeply apologize little one.

How did you die?

I-In my home.

I thought I could drink away the pain.

Instead, I made it worse.

Once I had joined my passengers.

I could understand, what it felt like to be let down.

They depended on me.

It wasn't your fault.

These things happen.

We don't control life.

Life controls us.

Are you sure you're the little girl I spoke to earlier?

You sound a lot older.

I don't know what is happening to me.

But whatever it is, I feel it has almost consumed me.

Like...I'm finally about to wake up.

Well, you are truly remarkable little one.

How is Stretch doin'?

H-He...didn't make it.

Poor kid.

It's okay little one.

He has arrived at his final station.

Speaking of which!

So are we!

Gustoph

Jeez! It's freezing out here!

But still, such an amazing view.

White fading into black.

I-Is this really me?

I don't normally talk like this.

Don't I?

Ahh! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!

I wish none of this ever happened!

I wish...I never...

Killed her.

!!!

What are you doing out here little guy?

Little Jacket couldn't help but overhear little girl.

Little Jacket wants to know why little girl is screaming?

Ug, ''little girl'' does have a name, ya know?

Little Jacket already knows Luzia's name!

What Little Jacket doesn't know is, why is Luzia upset?

Because, I don't know if I'm myself anymore?

I act differently, I fight with my older sister a lot more.

I feel like I've done something really bad...

But I have no idea what I've done.

This reminds Little Jacket of a story.

A story called the two sisters.

The two sisters?

Haven't you heard that story before?

Little Jacket will tell you.

Once upon a ti...

Is this going to be a long story?

Little Jacket doesn't have to tell you the story.

Okay, okay. Go ahead.

Once there were two sisters.

They were the best of friends.

They did everything together. They liked the same things.

They liked the same man.

Man only liked one of the sisters.

Man only liked the older one.

Man liked her silky-smooth, luscious legs.

Younger sister was upset.

Younger sister wanted man to like her instead.

Younger sister got witch to use magic to make legs like older sister.

Witch said, needs older sister's legs to make potion.

Younger sister cut off older sister's legs in her sleep.

Older sister died, lost too much blood.

Younger sister got nicer legs...but at a price.

Wait, I've heard this before.

Ashina...The Red Witch.

Red Witch yes, but not Ashina.

What do you mean by that?

Red Witch started curse.

Ashina not her real name.

Real name is...

Nice to see you again.

YOU ATE HIM!

Oh, I'm sorry.

You see, I'm very hungry Luzia.

And I still am.

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME!?

Oh? You think this is about you?

HA HA!

No my little friend.

I'm here to see my sister.

I know she is on this train.

Sister?

Yes, the one you call...Sombria.

But she's my sister!

She was your sister.

And when I find her, I'm going to break those god damn legs of hers!

You will not lay a finger on her you witch!

Not one finger...all of my fingers.

And then once I kill her, you're next...

...Mother.

This looks like some sort of entertainment stage.

S-Sombie!?

Are you okay?!

I-I'm...

What's wrong?!

Hello Luzia.

It's you!

Give me back my sister!

Luzia, I don't have much time.

You need to listen to me.

Why should I listen to you?!

You killed my sister!

Your sister is fine.

Trust me.

Why did you do this?

Because...I want this all to end.

What to end?

For hundreds of years, me and my sister have been stuck like this.

Trying to find a way to set us free.

I'm sorry Luzia, but this was the only way.

So you stole my sister's body?!

Do you think it's okay to steal other people's bodies?!

Luzia, you don't understand.

I don't have to!

This was your problem not ours!

Turn my sister back now!

I can't.

Not until the curse has been lifted.

Then how do I lift the curse?!

By breaking the loop.

We are already on our way to break the loop!

You are both heading towards the beginning.

Once you reach your home, you will restart the loop.

That's not true!

The Noodle Lady told me!

Luzia, don't listen to her.

She is lying to you.

She wants you to return home.

I will stay like this, for all eternity!

That is not my problem.

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!

You should of thought about that before you kidnapped us.

I-I know about your dreams.

The marketplace, the therapist.

Sombria won't admit that she has them too.

But why? Why would Sombie hide them from me?

It seems like she is protecting you.

Protecting me from what?

Sombria was easily drawn to me.

It's like we already had a connection.

But you...

Why you?

What is so special about you?

Mother warned me about you.

What are you talking about?!

It is remarkable that you have all the answers.

But why can't you answer this?

Luzia, something is going to happen soon.

And when the time comes...

You're going to have to make a choice.

What choice?

The choice to save your life...

...Or hers.

You don't mean me and Sombria?!

If you choose to listen to her be warned.

This will not go the way you think it will.

All I want is my sister back.

So we can go home.

But, there is something that still bugs me...

If you're not The Red Witch...

Then who is?

H-How did you know...

I finally found you.

Little sister.

Hiding in the bodies of the living.

For too long have I awaited this moment.

Hanging from your bathhouse wall like a photo frame.

Thinking of all those years how I could have spent my life.

Sister...I'm very sorr...

Shut up Ashina!

I've heard your lies through the centuries!

There is nothing you can say that will make me forgive you!

Please listen to me.

This little one, she may be the key to setting us free.

DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT FREEDOM!

You have no idea what it's like to have your damn legs cut off!

Then chained to a wall for centuries!

This is all mother's fault!

Was it?!

What is going on?

Go on sis! Tell her one of your famous lies.

You and your sister were not picked randomly.

The curse is like a living mother.

In order for it to survive it must give birth.

You two are its newest children.

The loop.

That's impossible!

We have a mother!

And so do we.

And she is going to pay also.

Leave these two out of this.

They are more than welcome to leave.

But you aren't going anywhere.

Luzia, take your sister and go.

The answers you seek lie somewhere on this train.

But only if you wish to find them.

Now go!

Thank god you're ok.

W-Who did this?

P-Pleasssse...

H-Help...meee...

ACH_IT_WAS_HER

!

LUZIA?!

Can you please keep it down!

I'm trying to listen out for my...

OH, SHUT UP YOURSELF! YA OLD CAVE BAT!

YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE ALREADY HERE!

They are?

Yes, Luzia! I'm here!

W-we need t-to go home...

Yes, we do! And now we can! I can't believe you're...

W-We...n-need t-to go...

...home.

No...NO!

NO,NO,NO!

LUZIA! DON'T GO PLEASE!!!

*Giggle*

Syke!

A HA HA HA!

B-B-but h-how?

Oh, I've been awake for the last couple of days now.

I just unplugged my heart machine cord...thingy.

ARHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Geez, Sombie, take it easy. It's just a prank.

A PRANK?!

I'LL SHOW YOU A PRANK!

Can you please keep it...

If you open your mouth again, I will choke you with your fluid cord!

Sombie, calm down.

I'm...I'm sorry, Luzia.

I was really scared.

Scared of what?

That you wouldn't wake up.

Duh, that's what happens after you sleep.

You wake up.

Luzia, I want to say I'm sorry for everything.

I just wanted to show mom I can be responsible.

And it seems like I failed both of you.

It's not your fault, Sombie.

It is, Luzia.

Because of me, you will never walk again!

That's because I'm lying down you dummy.

I guess they haven't told you yet.

Oh, wait!

I know what you're talking about!

The doctor said I'll be fine.

It was just a scratch!

Can you believe it?!

This is too good to be true.

Yeah, he thought I was someone else!

The nurse gave him the wrong files.

Oh! And they gave me cake to say sorry!

WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY TELL ME ANYTHING?!

Hey, pipe down!

You'll upset granny next door!

I just can't believe this all happened.

Right under my nose

Hey, can we get some waffles?!

I've got a bad craving for some waffles!

Okay, sure.

I'll see the nurse about your discharge.

ACH_GOOD_ENDING

And that was the last time I stayed at the Dayfield Motel!

I wish you would just...wake up, Luzia.

I can't stand to see you like this anymore.

I want my sister back...

M-My real sister back.

Please, if you can hear me...

Give me a sign.

It's been 3 weeks now!

I hope the fourth one is the charm!

...I don't think that's how it goes.

It doesn't matter!

You will wake up! I know it!

I...just do...

Please.

I-I didn't mean to do it.

I-It was an accident

I-I wish I just had slowed down.

The corner...the car...

I wish we never even went to see mom that day!

I'm so sorry Luzia!

Because of my mistake you will never walk again!

Just please wake up!

I-I guess I'll just have to wait until you're ready.

Christ! *Sniff* I need a smoke.

I'll be right back Luzia.

W-We need t-to go home...

TrueEndingScene

And that's why Mr. Gustoph had a drinking problem.

Mom said she would be here soon.

I don't see what's taking her so long?

She works here.

*Sigh* Who am I kiddin'?

You can't hear me anyway.

Excuse me deary?

Can you please keep it down?

I'm waiting for my daughters to arrive, and I can't hear them.

*Sigh* I'm sorry.

I'll keep my voice down for you.

Thank you.

Main Foyer

I'll come back right after I have a smoke.

I-It's a giant doll...

RealVerd

That's a cute doll you have there.

Hey! Thanks!

Her name's Molly!

Heh, I know Verd.

Now, don't you loose her again.

I won't Sombria!

Please, call me Sombie.

Luzia always does.

How is Luzia, she's been here a for a long time now.

She's doing really well!

...I hope.

I'm sure she will wake up soon!

Then she can play with me and Molly!

Wanna play tea party?

Sorry Verd. I've got stuff to do.

RealButcher

Hey Sombs, hows it goin'?

...Not so good.

Still worried about Luzia, eh?

She's a tough kid.

She'll be alright.

I hope so.

Still seeing the psychologist?

Got no choice.

Either this or jail.

What did you do to win that deal?

Tried to rob a gas station, with a butcher's knife and a mask.

But, I couldn't do it in the end.

I scared the kid standing next to me.

I just couldn't do it after I saw her cry.

So, I gave her a candy bar and waited for the cops.

At least you did the right thing.

Yeah, I guess!

Are you seeing him today?

Nah, I don't really want to see him anymore.

I don't blame ya. The guy's a creep!

Anyway, I'll probably be ready to go in soon.

Well, good luck in there.

I'll catch ya later Sombs!

RealAshina

Hey! Can I ask you something?

Uh, sure?

Who does your hair?

It's so cute!

Uh, thanks.

My mom does it for me.

It's a traditional look, apparently.

Pfft! She looks more like a big mouse!

I don't know why you want to look like her, Ashina.

Don't mind her, she's just jealous!

More like you're jealous!

Yeah, right.

The only thing I would be jealous about is that you're taller than me!

She has really nice legs ya know?

See? Jealous!

Yes I know, you both fight about this every day.

You girls visiting your mother again?

How come your mother is a lot older than you two?

Well, she's not really our mother.

She's our grandmother.

Our mother died and she just took over.

You can thank her for that.

She died giving birth to her.

I'm sorry to hear that.

It's fine, we have a new mother now.

Yeah, whats left of her that is.

I'll catch up with you two later.

Okay, talk to you later.

I still love your hair!

I'm not in the mood for talking.

Talk to my sister, she never shuts up.

G-Gustoph?

RealGustoph

Ah! Sombria my darling!

How's da little one?!

She's getting much better!

The doctor said she could wake up anytime now.

That's grand news, young one!

I wish all the best for your younger sibling!

Thanks, Gustoph.

How is everything with you?

Well, so far, everything is good!

I have cut back de' drinking!

And I can return to work next week!

Well, maybe.

That's still good news!

I wish the best for you!

And hope you can drive those trains again soon!

Thank you, young one.

You're a very nice girl.

And I'm sure your sister will be fine.

Now time for a littlt *yawn*...nap....Zzz.

RealStretch

Remember me?

O-Oh yes.

You're Somboro right?

Actually, it's Sombria.

But that was a pretty good guess.

I'm sorry about that.

I don't usually come in here.

Well, only to use the vending machine.

The one at the hotel is...

I know, I know. It's broken.

You say that every day when you come here.

I come here every day?

Yep, every break you have.

I noticed that you never buy anything from the machine.

I buy snacks from the machine all the time!

Okay, okay Mister, I'm not making it obvious.

Just make sure you don't stare at my butt for too long.

Was I really that obvious!?

I'm so sorry.

It's fine.

I've known for awhile now.

I feel like an idiot.

I should hide in a closet somewhere.

And never come out.

Well, maybe you should.

But then you wouldn't be able to see my butt.

I promise I won't look at it anymore.

You can look at it when ever you want.

But next time, just talk to me.

It's a much better way to break the ice.

Thanks, Sombria.

It feels like she has been that coma forever.

I just need a sign.

Anything...

...please?

It's getting way too cold out here now.

I better head inside.

GoodSmoke

Christ! I needed that!

It's getting too cramped in there.

We need to go home, Luzia.

I know you can pull through.

I just want us to forget this ever happened.

But I can't...

It'll haunt me til' the day I die.

Just please be alright, Luzia.

I better see how Luzia is doing.

Although, I already know nothing has changed.

And maybe, it never will.

A subway station?

Where is home?!

Sombie!?

I-I remember this place...

I used to come here all the time.

W-When I was upset.

You did?

Why were you upset for?

I-I just, get like that sometimes.

I can't explain it.

So, you're depressed?

I'm not even surprised by your intelligence anymore.

Luzia, I've been like this for a very long time.

Does mom know?

I don't like to share this with anyone.

But you told me.

Who else have you told?

Just my therapist.

I basically tell him everything.

But he doesn't help.

Isn't he supposed to?

I guess, but he...

...look, never mind.

You can tell me?

I-I can't...I'm sorry, Luzia.

I just need some time to myself, please.

Okay, I'm going to do some exploring.

Do you remember where the exit is?

I can't remember right now.

Okay, but don't go anywhere.

You can be depressed here okay?

Lighten up Sombie, it's just a joke.

I'll be back soon.

Boy, am I hungry!

Too bad I don't have any money!

It's...

Another sink.

MetalPipe

There's a loose pipe here.

It could be useful.

It's not working.

I wonder where it goes?

It's a long way down.

...a long way down.

...but.

It smells like...

Chocolate?

This seems so stupid.

What is that sound?

W-What are you?

*Shakes head*

Can you talk?

Can you understand me?

*Nods*

Okay, I need to reach the basement.

Is there a way down?

*Points to candy bar*

You want this?

Well, could you do me a favor?

I need to turn on the backup generator.

Where did you go?!

Hey! You did it!

Here you go, you deserve it!

I wonder...

Why would people throw chocolate down the elevator shaft?

And yet, it smells like chocolate down here?

I-I can hear you in there.

I need to talk to you.

Leave me alone.

You know I can't do that, right?

You're my big sister!

I'm supposed to be around you to annoy you.

Y-You...you don't understand.

Luzia, you will never understand!

But Sombie...

I do understand.

I understand what it's like to be alone.

To have no one.

To have no life left to live.

That's why I made the loop.

You're just say...

Wait! What?!

I know who I really am now.

I am the one who caused all this.

You can't be!

I made this loop to protect you.

To protect me from what?!

F-From...

...killing yourself.

Killing myself?!

It's starting to make sense now.

Sombria, this is the place...

Where you die.

You are not my sister!

I was scared!

I was scared that I might lose you!

I was never going to!

I was going to chicken out!

Sometimes...we don't chicken out.

I know I can't stop you...

Even though I tried to.

I know this is not my choice.

It's yours.

I can't save you...

But I can help you.

We still have a shot to break the loop.

You need to trust me.

Sombie! Show him! Please! 

I...

...O-okay.

We need to do this together.

I think you were right about what you said before.

About what?

That this feels like someone else's problem.

I don't know what is going to happen.

But I want you there when something does.

Luzia, thank you.

For everything.

So are you coming?

In a minute.

I sorta need to go while I'm in here anyway.

Okay, I'll meet you at the exit.

I found this doll.

Do you want it?

I can't leave without Sombie.

Yuck!

Maybe Sombie will eat it.

I could enter through here!

If I were a lot smaller.

I need to find something to widen the gap.

I'll use this to pry open the window.

I can just unlock the door now.

It's an old computer.

At least it still works.

It must open the gate next door.

How am I going to use an elevator without power?

Okay, now we have power.

Well, you're cheeky, aren't ya!

I am Verdinya, but everyone calls me Verd.

Everyone?

Yes!

I have friends ya know!

So what are you doing here?

My sister and I are trying to get home.

We just got off the train.

Train?

Trains haven't come through this subway for 10 years!

Wait?!

How can you see me right now?!

You're alive?!

So you're a ghost huh?

I'm not a ghost!

I'm a girl!

I'm just a dead girl!

What is your name?!

My name is Luzia...I think.

...Luzia?

You know me already?

You're the one that did this to us!

What?! Me?!

Yes! You witch!

I'm no...

...witch?

Thanks to you, we're all stuck in limbo!

Don't act dumb with me!

You're The Red Witch!

WHAT?!

THAT'S NOT TRUE!

THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

You are!

You're just...

A little girl?

That's because I am not the witch!

All of us deadies know you are!

To obtain ones true desire, The Red Witch will conspire!

You cannot lie to me!

But I'm...not...me...

Am I really the witch?

Why does everyone hate me?

Because you left us all in purgatory!

In this godforsaken loop!

The loop?

Did I create the loop?

You don't know your own story?

Damn! You really did lose your mind!

I-I don't remember anything.

The last thing I remember is waking up.

I couldn't sleep, so I went to find Sombria.

I know Sombria!

She's the girl that comes here to cry!

To cry?

She said she comes here when she's...

Depressed?

Yeah, she does depress a lot, he he!

Why did I create this loop?

To punish us!

You put all of us in Purgatory!

All for your sister's sake!

My sister?

What are you talking about?

Do you know why your sister comes here all the time?!

Because she's depressed?

Ha ha!

All of us have a tragic story of how we died.

Your sister is looking for hers too.

...no...Sombie.

You created the loop to trap her and all of us here!

Just so you could keep her alive!

JUST LET HER DIE!!!

So we all can!

I...I can't.

You don't understand, she is my sister!

I don't understand?

I'M ALREADY DEAD!

I CAN'T MOVE ON!

We all have to make choices that we don't like.

What would happen if she did?

We could all move on.

The loop would be broken.

I have a hard choice to make.

You owe us.

We've suffered a lot longer than you have.

I need to speak to Sombria.

I'll be back.

Well, I ain't goin' no where.

Thanks to you.

LastChance

So...

What's it gonna be? Witch.

I have made my decision.

And?

I'm going to break the loop.

I'm going to be free from this nightmare?!

Yes, we all will.

Including my sister.

W-What?!

No!

Please!

We have suffered enough!

I don't know if I am one who made the loop.

But I do know, that I am the one to end it.

Let her die!

It's the only way!

There is...another.

I know there is.

FINE!

JUST LEAVE US HERE!

YOU WITCH!

Verd.

GO AWAY!

Before I go.

I thought you may want your doll back.

M-Molly?!

W-Where did you find her?!

My sister found her.

I-I lost her, over 10 years ago.

I died trying to find her.

I...fell, onto the tracks.

How did you know she was mine?

I know what it's like to lose someone special.

It's a special sense you get.

T-Thank you.

We're just like you.

Trying to find a way home.

It looks like I was told a lie.

The Noodle Lady was wrong about you.

The Noodle Lady?

She talks about the story of The Red Witch all the time.

But she never mentioned you to be so...nice.

The Noodle Lady told you I was The Red Witch?

She said, only The Red Witch can break the loop.

But to break it, she must spill the blood of her sister.

I-I'm sorry for how I acted back there.

I've forgotten that I was once was alive.

I will break the loop...I promise.

Good luck, Luz...

What is it?

There's that laugh again.

We... G-good luck Luzia.

Mmhmm?

Well, I am actually Luzia thank you very much!

You're just a cranky old lady!

Want to play games huh?

I love to play games!

How about truth or dare?

W-What?

*Sigh* Truth or dare.

Okay, okay...truth.

Playing it safe, huh? Okay.

Have you ever kissed a boy?

Okay, your turn.

Truth or...

Dare! Ha!

Watcha gonna do now?!

Well I dare you to kill me!

COME ON! KILL ME!

NO!

KILL YOURSELF!

...Truth.

Why are you naked?

Because I've got nothing to hide.

Wait, isn't it my turn?

We've all had enough turns at this game.

I want you to end it.

...How do I end the loop?

Kill The Red Witch.

Who is The Red Witch?

...Dare.

Kill me...

For Sombria.

Why is that your answer?

Sombie has suffered enough from me.

Ever since I was little.

All I ever did was get in her way and interrupt her life.

I don't deserve someone like her.

Go home...

Just go...now.

Self sacrifice...

Your mother was pathetic, in giving you my name...

I did what was possible to keep my daughters alive.

But you're not going to take them away from me.

ACH_FAKE_LUZIA

We made it!

Sombie! We're finally home!

Yes...we did

It's good to finally see home again.

And now we can stop this cursed loop, and bring you back to normal!

...Right?

I-I guess so.

Are you feeling alright, Luzia?

I feel great! Just like pickles!

Why? Aren't you feeling good, too?

O-Oh I am, but, you seem different.

You seem...normal?

Umm, what are you talking about?

I've always been normal?

You seem, less intelligent than before.

Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!

Are you calling me dumb?!

N-No no, I didn't mean it like tha...

Well, you're ugly! And stupid!

And you look like a freak!

Maybe...I am just a freak after all.

That's right! Run!

Another bobby pin?

How many does Sombie need to keep those balls of hair up?

If only I had a shovel.

It's The Butcher's knife?

There's some writing on the handle.

Good luck kid! Butcher.

Heh, he trusts me with knives now.

Y-Yes...I was sick

My poor darling.

Once you're done up there, I will make you a bowl of noodles.

Is there something wrong, Luzia?

You seem, shaken.

W-Who me?

I'm fine

If you say so.

I'll wait here until you return.

I just want to say...thanks.

For helping me understand Sombria.

Oh, you're very welcome my dear.

I know what I have to do.

Where'd she go?!

The big cry baby!

It's cold outside.

The windows are frosting over.

That's enough imagination for me.

Hey, can I ask you something?

Who? Me?

Yes, you.

You can ask me anything my dear.

Truth or dare?

This isn't the time to be playing gam...

Truth...or dare?

Fine!

Truth!

I've told you before!

I am Yokona Kagam...

You're lying again.

Luzia, you shouldn't be putting your nose into...

You seemed so eager to play this game with me before.

So, play it with me now.

Who are you?!

I'm...Luzia...Sombria's conscience.

I am an older envision of you.

But a far better one.

Wait! Don't I get a turn?

Haven't you had enough turns at this game?

Why am I so different now?

Pfft!

Haven't you noticed anything lately?

Now that your mother is gone...

Your personality will change, back to its stupid old self.

Your pathetic mother's spirit was infused with yours.

Until she died! HA!

She failed to break the loop!

Now you will follow in her footsteps!

Enough of this pathetic game!

Your time is up, Luzia!

TRUTH OR DARE!

DARE!!!

What are you gonna do about that!

*Sniff*

I d-dare..

I dare you..

WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU DARE ME TO DO?!

I dare you, to listen to my little secret.

A secret?!

HA HA HA! Is that all?!

Okay, Luzia.

What's your secret?

For telling me the truth.

Finally.

I could really could just go back to bed.

I've missed you so much.

Wow! I never thought I'd ever say that!

But...I feel...

So...sleepy...

NO! I can't go to sleep just yet!

I can't keep my eyes open.

I can't take it anymore.

Zzz.

Say your prayers screws!

I always loved this picture.

My bow looks great!

Thanks, mom!

I'll let her stay in there until she wants to be nice to me.

Besides, it's locked anyway...

And, awfully...quiet?

H-Hey Sombie?

I just wanted to check on you.

No, not yet.

I'm still mad at her.

I'll come back in a little while.

I can't use it.

THE BAD ENDING

Sombie.

S-She's...gone.

She told you didn't she?

She told you everything.

She did.

So what are you going to do now?

I have to do what is right.

Then do it.

Where are you going?

I'm going to bed, it's late.

What do you mean it's late?

Why won't you kill...

Because I don't have to.

I may be twelve, but I can tell when a story is done.

I'll see you in the morning.

But...h-how?

...Sombria

She doesn't know...does she?

What?! She doesn't know?

How many times has she been in this godforsaken loop?

She needs to wake up.

You know she won't

She needs to die!

Wait. Is that what you saw in the tunnel Sombria?

You know you cannot save her?

I can try.

She saved me remember?

Besides, she's my sister...

Thank you for playing My Big Sister.\n\n(press button to continue)

...Is this how your story ends?

I'm sure you can find a better ending than this one.

Gee, you're up early.

I wanted to *munch* eat some cereal!

I can see that.

Sooo...

About last night?

You mean this morning?

Yes, I mean this morning.

Yeah?

How did you know?

How did I know what?

How did you know how to break the loop?

Oh! *Munch* That!

See, what I did was *munch,munch,munch*

And then,*munch,munch,munch*

Oh! And I also,*munch,munch,munch*

And voila!,*munch,munch,munch*

What kind of cereal are you eating anyway?

Crunchy hearts! What else!

Uh, why is the milk red?

And what's that lump in the middle of the bowl?

It's just cereal, okay! *Munch*

Geez! *munch munch*

ACH_A_MOTHERS_HEART

Can you not talk with your mouth full.

It's disgusting!

There! Your majesty!

Now...

Before you say anything...

I want to say...

Love you, big sis.

And I love you too, ya little knuckle head!

If you tell anyone I said that, I'll really kill you.

Yeah, sure.

Hey, listen.

Do you wanna go grab some waffles or something at Daisy's?

AHHH! I haven't had waffles in ages!

You better not be lyin' to me!

Come on, go get ready.

I'm already ready!

ACH_A_HAPPY_ENDING

Hey! What are you doing in our house?!

Oh, me?

I thought I'd drop by.

Just to see if you two made it back alright.

It took a while, but we made it!

So, where's your sister?

Pffft, probably crying in her room.

Serves her right for calling me dumb.

Now that is not very sisterly, is it?

I don't care!

She should be nice to me!

Yes, she should.

That's right!

She should!

It's not like she thanked me for helping her get home or anything!

And it was me who did everything!

Maybe we should remind her of your efforts, Luzia.

But how?

Just tell her how ungrateful she was for you help.

That she just got in your way.

She is going to get it!

Not another sink.

It's Sombie's mug.

It smells like ciggaretts.

I remember when Sombie caught her hands...

Wow...

That's not even funny anymore.

I don't need  to do that.

There's a picture on here.

It's the basement door.

But, the door looks like it's gonna fall off anyway.

The screws on the hinges are loose.

TrueEnding

Ah, you called my name.

It seems my mother was wrong. You are the smart one.

Not, Luzia.

Now that we're finally meeting, would you like to see something?

I can show you the TRUE ending to this story.

Are you ready?

Then kill my mother, and save Sombria.

I can hear something.

It sounds like someone calling my name.

Should I call back?

It's a mirror.

Basement Door

Mirror

...L-Luzia.

A-Are you still there?

W-What have you done?

M-My heart...

Why didn't you just let me die?

What's all this noise down here?

Sombria?!

Is that you?!

MOM?!

What are you doing down here?!

What happened to you?!

Sombria, please tell me you took the key with you?

W-What? N-No it's upstairs...

What was that?!

Luzia?!

Luzia! Unlock this door right now!

LUZIA!!!

I-Is s-someone there?

H-Hello?

Lu...Luzia?!

Is that really you!

W-What are you?!

I-It's me!

P-please remember!

It's me!

M-Mom?!

Y-Yes my sweetheart.

MOM!!!

This is going to sound strange to you...

But...your sister did this.

She created this place, these people...these stories.

This is all Sombie's fault?!

Y-Yes...and n-no.

See, your sister is a very special girl.

So I'm not special?!

You girls are very special to me.

I-I mean Sombria's a witch.

SOMBIE'S THE RED WITCH?!

Y-Yes...

H-How do you know that?

All this time I thought I was!

Y-You've been speaking to t-the Noodle Lady have you?

Yes, how do you know that?

I-It's the loop.

Everything that you've seen, heard and felt...

They're all just distractions.

I-It's Sombria's emotions...her imagination.

She created all of it....

But, why?

B-Because...

S-She's...

...Depressed.

I've tried to talk to her.

But she won't listen to me.

I-I tried to break the loop m-myself.

But...I failed.

T-That's why I'm here.

But, you still have a chance, Luzia.

But why me?

I haven't been myself lately.

B-Because you two are sisters, Luzia.

For some reason, you both can understand each other.

I can't explain it...

But, you two have a special connection with each other.

Y-You, share each others thoughts, emotions and imagination.

I guess, parents just don't get it.

But, Luzia...

You...

Have to kill Sombria...

But...I can't.

Luzia! Please! I would have it any other way!

But this is the only way!

I can't kill my sister!

You have to, Luzia!

Please, it will bring everything to peace...

Even your sister.

How do I know you're not lying to me?!

You were never there when we needed you!

Luzia! I did everything I could for you girls!

I even risked my own life, to save Sombria!

I've sacrificed myself, to make sure you both have a life!

Please...you have to trust me.

But how would I kill her?

I left you a clue under Sombie's door.

I'm not sure if you got it earlier.

So I put it on the refrigerator.

Please...do this for Sombria.

I...I...

I know...

I can't make up your mind for you.

That's for you to decide...and you only.

Just, promise me something, Luzia.

Yes mommy?

Never forget, that I love you both, so very very much...

I won't, I promis...

Mom?!

It's mom's gardening shovel.

...mom...

MomsHeart

It's been a while since we've been here.

Where are my damn waffles!

Hey, take it easy tiger.

I need waffles!

Sorry sis.

But I've been in a coma for like forever!

Okay, okay.

I see you're back to your normal self again.

No, I'm back to my hungry self.

WHERE ARE THESE DAMN WAFFLES?!

H-Hey, Luzia.

Can I show you something after breakfast?

It's sorta' my secret place to chill out.

It's not a boring place is it?

No way! It's got everything!

A swing, a great view and big ol' tree!

Does it have dinosaurs?

W-Well, no.

Then it doesn't have everything.

*Sigh* Lil' sis, I've missed you.

And I've missed you too, Sombie.

And you're long arms.

Where are my damned waffles!

Sorry sis, but I need something other than noodles!

Wow! I didn't think you'd ever get sick of food.

Hey now! I said noodles, not food!

You leave food alone!

Okay, okay, geez.

Yeah...

I know, Luzia.

I'm sorry about mom.

You couldn't help it.

I know she's still here.

Nagging us to brush our teeth and stuff.

Heh, maybe you to brush your teeth.

You mean, this whole time you were off the hook?!

I would have made you brush your teeth with the toilet brush!

Heh, it's good to have you back, Luzia.

And you too, big sis!

You know...

You still haven't told me how you figured all this out.

I know.

It's our little secret.

Our secret?

But you haven't told me?

No, not you.

The person behind the screen.

Okay, Luzia. Whatever you say.

Hey! After breakfast, I wanna show you something.

My little secret.

Okay, but it better not be a crab with a knife!

Those things are dangerous!

Luzia, you need to stop watching too much tv.

Think of what?

This place?

It's pretty neat.

It has a swing after all.

Well, at least you're enjoying yourself.

This is my secret place!

I usually come here to chill out.

But I can't anymore.

How come?

Because I have to baby sit you silly!

But now, we can enjoy it together.

Hey, Sombie!

Mhmm?

Who are all those people?

What people?

All the people at the hospital.

They said goodbye to you when we were leaving.

Oh, they were just the regulars.

I've been visiting you every day.

So I got to know them.

Huh, the funny thing is though...

They were all in my dream.

But, they weren't people.

They were ghosts!

That's the imagination of a girl who watches too much TV!

Hey! At least I have an imagination.

Yours would just be about boys and depressing music.

And I wouldn't change it for the world.

Speaking of boys...

You still seeing that loser?

Geez, when did you learn all of these fancy words?

And no.

I caught him making out with another girl...

In the back of his truck.

Doesn't he move furniture in that?

He did...until I rang his boss.

Kissing in a truck...eww, that's gross!

Don't ever change.

I won't.

But only if we can stay up late.

And, watch some scary movies!

Just don't tell mom.

It's okay, I guess.

This is my secret I was telling you about!

I used to come here everyday, after school.

It's...relaxing.

Lucky this place has a swing!

Otherwise, it would be boring!

Nothing ever pleases you, does it?

...Yeah...some things.

Like...stuff.

Is it weird talking to me like this?

Well...yeah, a little.

You've never been this...happy, before.

Yeah, that is weird.

So...what's gonna happen now?

Well, I guess I'm gonna have to look after you.

Seeing how...

Don't worry, her heart will always be inside of me.

*That sounded so weird*

It'll be okay.

Now that I have my big sis looking after me...

I can stay up as late as I want!

Oh no you ain't!

If you disobey me, you're living with Aunty Claire!

WHAT?! NO!

Her house is way too creepy!

Besides, she'll make me sleep with baby Mark!

He'll keep me up all night!

Hey, Luzia.

Calm down, I'm just kidding.

Hey, Sombie.

If you're the witch...

Where's your pointy hat and broom?

Luzia, I think this would be the best time to tell you.

We come from a very strange family.

Mom once told me that you and I share our great ancestors gift.

A gift?

Like super powers?

Ha! No, more like...un-natural abilities.

Well, that's what mom called it.

Mom made me see that therapist every week.

Because you were depressed?

She wanted me to control my emotions.

But, when I couldn't control them anymore.

I created the...loop.

Please, don't make another one!

I can't stand the sight of noodles anymore!

Ha ha! I don't think I will, Luzia.

I'm free to do what I want now.

Except smoking!

You promised!

I said maybe, Luzia.

Hmm, okay.

What's my gift?

I-I don't know, Luzia.

Mom said you did have one.

She just said you have a great imagination.

Thats not really a gift.

Everyone has an imagination, Sombie!

I guess you just have one of a kind.

IN MEMORY OF MY COUSIN BLAKE

Always thinking of you!

# My Big Sister:Remastered-Translations
For those who wish to translate MBSR in other languages other than the ones provided at launch

As you may know, My Big Sister:Remastered has very few translations as they are quite expensive for a heavy text based game and I can't afford to translate it into any other languages at this time, I deeply apologies to any of those who were missed. However, I'm opening up this file so that the community can add their own translations to MBSR, if they wish.

INSTRUCTIONS

1/Download the "English.trs" (or which ever languiage you wish to update "Portuguese.trs, Spanish.trs" e.c.t) file to your pc.

2/Open this link in any web browser: https://tzachshabtay.github.io/ags-trs-editor/

2/Click the little upload cloud symbol in the top left and select the "English.trs" file.

3/ Go nuts, lol! Click on any line and retype the line out to add your translation.

4/ To update the file you'll need to click the save cloud icon, it will download a new version of the script file to your downloads folder (It's a pain but it's mainly for back ups in case something goes wrong). If you close your browser it will reset the page and you will need to reimport the trs file. Use the one you downloaded to continue where you left off.

Alternatively, you can open it in a text document and work on it there, just be sure not to change ANY of the text on the above lines and only the empty spaces beneath. [Example] { Today is bright and sunny. o dia est√° claro e ensolarado <- Add translations here (Pardon the cheap translation) Perhaps, tomorrow will be too! <- Do not change the original text as it will result in a game crash or corrupt file. <- Add translations here Hmm, is that a cloud? <- Add translations here }

Once there done just swing me a message and I'll add them to the game :)
